## PART 1: CRITICAL ERRORS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE CORRECTION

### 1.1 Spacing Errors (Throughout the document)

**Issue Type:** Missing spaces between words
**Frequency:** Multiple occurrences throughout the paper

#### Error #1: "toJournal" → "to Journal"
- **Location:** Header on every page (Pages 1-22)
- **Current Text:** "Submitted toJournal Not Specifiedfor"
- **Correction:** "Submitted to Journal Not Specified for"
- **Reason:** Missing space between preposition "to" and noun "Journal"

#### Error #2: "Specifiedfor" → "Specified for"
- **Location:** Header on every page (Pages 1-22)
- **Current Text:** "Submitted toJournal Not Specifiedfor"
- **Correction:** "Submitted to Journal Not Specified for"
- **Reason:** Missing space between "Specified" and "for"

#### Error #3: "whatis said" → "what is said"
- **Location:** Page 2, Line 40
- **Current Text:** "the accuracy of textual content (i.e.,whatis said)"
- **Correction:** "the accuracy of textual content (i.e., what is said)"
- **Reason:** Missing space between "what" and "is". Also add space after "i.e.,"

#### Error #4: "howit is said" → "how it is said"
- **Location:** Page 2, Line 41
- **Current Text:** "paralinguistic nuances (i.e.,howit is said)"
- **Correction:** "paralinguistic nuances (i.e., how it is said)"
- **Reason:** Missing space between "how" and "it". Also add space after "i.e.,"

### 1.2 Grammar Errors

#### Error #5: Article Usage - "a Additive" → "an Additive"
- **Location:** Page 9, Line 370
- **Current Text:** "assuming a Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)"
- **Correction:** "assuming an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)"
- **Reason:** Use "an" before words starting with vowel sounds
- **Academic Standard:** Correct article usage is essential in academic writing

#### Error #6: Adjective Form - "semantic preserved system"
- **Location:** Page 2, Line 76
- **Current Text:** "Han et al. developed a semantic preserved system"
- **Correction:** "Han et al. developed a semantic preservation system" OR "a semantically preserved system"
- **Reason:** The phrase "semantic preserved" is grammatically incorrect. Either use the noun form "preservation" or the adverbial form "semantically preserved"
- **Preferred:** "semantic preservation system" (more concise and academic)

---

## PART 2: STYLE AND WORD CHOICE IMPROVEMENTS

### 2.1 Word Choice Improvements

#### Suggestion #1: "feature accumulation errors"
- **Location:** Page 8, Line 356
- **Current Text:** "which may lead to feature accumulation errors"
- **Better Options:** 
  - "feature propagation errors"
  - "accumulated feature errors"
  - "compounding errors in features"
- **Reason:** "accumulation errors" is an awkward phrasing; "propagation errors" or "accumulated errors" is more standard in academic signal processing literature

#### Suggestion #2: Repeated Equation
- **Location:** Page 6, Lines 245-252
- **Issue:** Equations (7) and (8) are identical and appear consecutively
- **Current:** Both lines have "µ=P prior(ˆZc;ψp)∈RM×T"
- **Correction:** Remove the duplicate equation (8) as it serves no purpose

### 2.2 Punctuation Issues

#### Error #7: Space before comma
- **Location:** Page 8, Line 327
- **Current Text:** "for homogeneous transmission , this mechanism"
- **Correction:** "for homogeneous transmission, this mechanism"
- **Reason:** No space should appear before a comma in English

### 2.3 Consistency Issues

#### Suggestion #3: Inconsistent spacing with parenthetical abbreviations
- **Throughout the paper:**
  - Sometimes: "(i.e.,whatis said)" - missing spaces
  - Should be: "(i.e., what is said)" - space after comma
- **Standard:** Always include a space after "i.e.," and "e.g.," in academic writing

---

## PART 3: ACADEMIC WRITING STYLE ENHANCEMENTS

### 3.1 Clarity Improvements

#### Suggestion #4: Long sentences could be broken down
- **Location:** Page 2, Lines 42-47
- **Current:** Single long sentence spanning multiple concepts
- **Suggestion:** Consider breaking into 2-3 shorter sentences for better readability
- **Note:** While grammatically correct, academic readers prefer clearer, more digestible sentence structures

#### Suggestion #5: Use of "we" vs. passive voice
- **Observation:** The paper consistently uses "we" (e.g., "we propose," "we develop")
- **Status:** ✓ ACCEPTABLE - This is the modern standard in academic writing
- **Note:** Your usage is correct and follows current IEEE/ACM style guidelines

### 3.2 Technical Terminology - Generally Excellent

**Strengths identified:**
- ✓ Appropriate use of domain-specific terminology
- ✓ Proper citation formatting
- ✓ Clear mathematical notation
- ✓ Professional abstract structure
- ✓ Logical flow and organization

---

## PART 4: MINOR RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4.1 Consistency in Mathematical Notation

The mathematical notation is generally excellent. Minor observations:
- Ensure consistent spacing around operators (mostly correct)
- Vector notation is properly used with bold or arrows
- Subscripts and superscripts are appropriately formatted

### 4.2 Reference Formatting

The references appear well-formatted following academic standards. No corrections needed in this section.

## SUMMARY OF REQUIRED CHANGES

### HIGH PRIORITY (Must Fix):
1. ✗ Fix "toJournal" → "to Journal" (all pages)
2. ✗ Fix "Specifiedfor" → "Specified for" (all pages)
3. ✗ Fix "whatis said" → "what is said" (Page 2)
4. ✗ Fix "howit is said" → "how it is said" (Page 2)
5. ✗ Fix "a Additive" → "an Additive" (Page 9)
6. ✗ Fix "semantic preserved system" → "semantic preservation system" (Page 2)
7. ✗ Remove space before comma in "transmission ," → "transmission," (Page 8)
8. ✗ Remove duplicate equation (8) on Page 6

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Should Fix):
9. ○ Change "feature accumulation errors" → "feature propagation errors" (Page 8)
10. ○ Review all instances of "i.e.," and "e.g.," for proper spacing

### LOW PRIORITY (Consider):
11. ◎ Break down some longer sentences for improved readability
12. ◎ Ensure consistent formatting throughout

## CONCLUSION

Your paper demonstrates strong academic English writing skills. The technical content is clearly communicated, and the overall structure is professional. However, the spacing errors (particularly in the header) appear throughout all 22 pages and must be corrected before submission. The grammar issues are minimal but important to fix for a polished final draft.

**Recommendation:** With the corrections outlined above, this paper will meet the high standards of academic English required for publication in top-tier journals.
